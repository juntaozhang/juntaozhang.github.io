/*
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

/*
Thoughts:
Create 2 path: l1, l2.
First different node's parent, will be the LCA
Do binary search to generate the path l1,l2

Note:
When one of the target is root, make sure parent = root, and return root at the end. This is because: the if statement (l1.get(i).val != l2.get(i).val) won't capture this case; instead, the for loop ends by i == size. So, be careful here.
