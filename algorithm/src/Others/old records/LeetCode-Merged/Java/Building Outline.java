/*
Given N buildings in a x-axis，each building is a rectangle and can be represented by a triple (start, end, height)，where start is the start position on x-axis, end is the end position on x-axis and height is the height of the building. Buildings may overlap if you see them from far away，find the outline of them。

An outline can be represented by a triple, (start, end, height), where start is the start position on x-axis of the outline, end is the end position on x-axis and height is the height of the outline.

Example
Given 3 buildings：

[
  [1, 3, 3],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [5, 6, 1]
]
The outlines are：

[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [5, 6, 1]
]
Note
Please merge the adjacent outlines if they have the same height and make sure different outlines cant overlap on x-axis.

/*
Attempt1, may not be correct.
Thoughts: 
PriorityQueue<Point>, sort by start.
1. Keep track of max height. 
2. Find max height.
3. Poll() queue
	a. on left of highest building, When height increate, record this point(x, height)
	b. on right of highest building, when height decreses, record this point.
