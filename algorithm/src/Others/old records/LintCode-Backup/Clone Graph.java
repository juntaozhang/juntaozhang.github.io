/*
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/

    //NEED TO RUN THIS ON LINT
    Thoughts: 12.12.2015
    The original thoughs of using ArrayList, and using a index to track of which node has not been visited.
        It's alright, but it uses extra space, and basically copie all nodes again.
        It's similar to using a queue.
        At the end, it's doing O(m * n)
    Maybe can improve this.

    Need a queue and process each element. and a hashmap to track duplicates.
        1. make sure the node is no duplicate
        2. make sure to all all child

    border: case: node == nul, or node has not child, return a new instance of it'self?

Thinking process:
1. Clone all nodes available: using HashMap to go through all possible query. No duplicates added using HashMap.
    HashMap map has the list of all new nodes. No neighbors added yet
    <key,value> = <original node,  new node with just a label (without neighbor list)>
    At same time, the arrayList nodes has all original nodes(with neighbors) in Breadth-first order.
2. Add neighbor for nodes in map:
    - Locate the 'newNode' from map by using the key: the original node
    - loop through the original node's neighbor size
    - use original neighbor as key to get the new neighbor instance from map
    - add this new neighbor instance to the neighbor list of 'newNode'
