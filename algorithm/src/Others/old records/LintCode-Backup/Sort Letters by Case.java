/*
Given a string which contains only letters. Sort it by lower case first and upper case second.

Example
For "abAcD", a reasonable answer is "acbAD"

Note
It's not necessary to keep the original order of lower-case letters and upper case letters.

Challenge
Do it in one-pass and in-place.

Thoughts:
Another two pointer sorting.
Difference: use a ASCII code 'a' as the pivot. all the letters that from a ~ z 
have bigger integer values, and A~Z have small integer values.
This problem requires lowcase+upperCase, so we'd sort the list from high to low.
NOTE: in the 2 while loop, the it's always having ">='
