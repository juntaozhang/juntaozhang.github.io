/*
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Thinking process:
0. This problem can be done using sorting, but time complexity of sorting is O(nlogn). This problem requires O(n).
1. Want to check if a number's left and right is consecutive to itself, but cannot do it due to the given unsorted array: think about a Hashmap.
2. HashMap(Key, Value) = (the number itself, boolean: have been counted or not). If you count a number as a consecutive, you only need to count it once.
3. How HashMap works: 
	when checking a number's consecutive, look at number--, number++, see if they are in the HashMap. If exist, means consecutive.
	If a number exist in the hashmap and its value is 'true', then we need to skip this number beacuse it has been checked.
4. Track the total number consecutives of 1 perticular number, compare it with the maxL. Save the Math.max to maxL.
5. Depending on the problem, we can store a consecutive sequence or simply just its length: maxL. This problem wants the maxL.

Thougths:
1. sort
2. use a 'count' and 'max' to keep track of consecutive elements
3. one-pass

Note:
Take care of equal numbers: skip/continue those
