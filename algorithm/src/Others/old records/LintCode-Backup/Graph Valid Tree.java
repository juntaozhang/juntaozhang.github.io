复习Union-Find的另外一个种形式。
题目类型：查找2个元素是不是在一个set里面。如果不在，false. 如果在，那就合并成一个set,共享parent.
存储的关键都是：元素相对的index上存着他的root parent.

另一个union-find， 用hashmap的：http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/find-the-weak-connected-component-in-the-directed-graph/

/*
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), 
write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

Example
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.

Note
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. 
Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

	Thoughts: do union-find. //http://www.jiuzhang.com/solutions/graph-valid-tree/
	How to check if we have disconnected pair? Think about it:
		A valid tree has n-1 edges. If we have 1 disconnected pair, that means,
		we lost 1 edge, like n-2 edgets now. 
		OR, keep thinking: if we have a cycle, which is a extra edge, that becomes n edgets.
	Therefore, a first check (assume if with n-1 edgets is valid), just check if edges.lenght == n -1.

	Then, natually we can think of : what if missing a couple edges and have a couple cycles,
	which makes edges.length == n - 1?
	So if in this complex case, there must be >=1 cycles. Now just explicitly check for cycle. 
	How to use unin-find to check no cycle: 
***		if a pair of node has same parent. If they do, that makes an triangle. False.
	
	What does Union-Find do?
	Union-Find is a data structure (this problem implemented as a array), that union 2 sets and 
	checks if 2 elements are in the same set.
	In another problem, it can be implemented with HashMap as well.
