/*
There is an integer matrix which has the following features:

The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
The matrix has n rows and m columns.
For all i < m, A[0][i] < A[1][i] && A[n - 2][i] > A[n - 1][i].
For all j < n, A[j][0] < A[j][1] && A[j][m - 2] > A[j][m - 1].
We define a position P is a peek if:

A[j][i] > A[j+1][i] && A[j][i] > A[j-1][i] && A[j][i] > A[j][i+1] && A[j][i] > A[j][i-1]
Find a peak element in this matrix. Return the index of the peak.

Example
Given a matrix:

[
  [1 ,2 ,3 ,6 ,5],
  [16,41,23,22,6],
  [15,17,24,21,7],
  [14,18,19,20,10],
  [13,14,11,10,9]
]
return index of 41 (which is [1,1]) or index of 24 (which is [2,2])

Note
The matrix may contains multiple peeks, find any of them.

Challenge
Solve it in O(n+m) time.

If you come up with an algorithm that you thought it is O(n log m) or O(m log n), can you prove it is actually O(n+m) or propose a similar but O(n+m) algorithm?
