/*
Given 2*n + 2 numbers, every numbers occurs twice except two, find them.

Example
Given [1,2,2,3,4,4,5,3] return 1 and 5

Challenge
O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

Thinking Process:
The 2 exception must have this feature: a ^ b != 0, since they are different
Still want to do 2n + 1 problem as in Single Number I, then we need to split a and b into 2 groups and deal with two 2n+1 problems
Assume c = a^b, there mush be a bit where a and b has the difference, so that bit in c is 1.
Find this bit position and use it to split the group: shift number in the array by ‘bit-position’ indexes. If the shifted number has 1 at the ‘bit-position’, set it to one group; otherwise to another group.
