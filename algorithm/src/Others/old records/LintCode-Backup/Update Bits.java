/*
Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)   



Example
Given N = (10000000000)2, M = (10101)2, i = 2, j = 6

return N = (10001010100)2

Thinking process:
Create a mask: xxxx000000xxxx.
Trick part: when it encounters negative number or dealing with index at edge index = 31, it starts having issue. Interesting fix: use long for masks.

     *@param i, j: Two bit positions
     *return: An integer

        leftMask = leftMask << (j + 1);//xxxxx00000000
        long mask = leftMask | rightMask;//xxx00000xxx
