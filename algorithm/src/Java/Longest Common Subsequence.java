/*
Given two strings, find the longest comment subsequence (LCS).

Your code should return the length of LCS.

Example
For "ABCD" and "EDCA", the LCS is "A" (or D or C), return 1

For "ABCD" and "EACB", the LCS is "AC", return 2

Clarification
What's the definition of Longest Common Subsequence?

    * The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two). (Note that a subsequence is different from a substring, for the terms of the former need not be consecutive terms of the original sequence.) It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of file comparison programs such as diff, and has applications in bioinformatics.

Thinking process:
Using DP.
check[i][j] means: the length of longest common subsequnce between A(0 ~ i) and B(0 ~ j).
Then there are two ways to reach check[i][j]:
1. A(i-1) == B(j - 1), then check[i][j] = check[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
2. A(i-1) != B(j - 1), then pick the max between (i-1,j) ,  (i,j-1)  and (i, j )
Note: check[][] is initialized with all 0's. Index (0,0) is used as starting 0.
