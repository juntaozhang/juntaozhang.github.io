Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Note
m and n will be at most 100.

Example
For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
The total number of unique paths is 2.

Thinking process:
1. Still use an extra matrix to count possible paths. 
2. When initializing, skip block if it's obstacle (break the for loop, basically skip this row/col)
3. When evaluating paths, skip block if it's obstacle (save current spot's path as 0, means no path through this point).
4. Note: At evaluating double-for loop, we cannot use break, because we still need to evaluate using upper/left block. Hence we set the obstacle = 0.
