比较特别的BFS.

几个graph的condition：   
1. 可能有多个root
2. directed node, 可以direct backwards.

Steps:    
Track all neighbors/childrens. 把所有的children都存在map<label, count>里面
先把所有的root加一遍，可能多个root。并且全部加到queue里面。

然后以process queue, do BFS:   
Only when map.get(label) == 0, add into queue && rst.    
这用map track apperance, 确保在后面出现的node, 一定最后process.

/*
Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
Find any topological order for the given graph.

Example
For graph as follow:

picture

The topological order can be:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
...
Note
You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.

Challenge
Can you do it in both BFS and DFS?

Thoughts:
First idea is Breadth First Search.
1. Find the node which has no parent node: this will be the beginning node. Use a HashMap to map all nodes with children, and whatever not in that map, is a root option.
2. Starting from this node, put all nodes in the queue (breadth-first)
3. process each node in the queue: add to array list


Note: All all possible root node (whatever not added into the map) because there could be multiple heads : (. Really need to ask about this if not sure.
