/*
The structure of Segment Tree is a binary tree which each node 
has two attributes start and end denote an segment / interval.

start and end are both integers, they should be assigned in following rules:

The root's start and end is given by build method.
The left child of node A has start=A.left, end=(A.left + A.right) / 2.
The right child of node A has start=(A.left + A.right) / 2 + 1, end=A.right.
if start equals to end, there will be no children for this node.
Implement a build method with two parameters start and end, so that we can create a corresponding segment tree 
with every node has the correct start and end value, return the root of this segment tree.

Example
Given start=0, end=3. The segment tree will be:

               [0,  3]
             /        \
      [0,  1]           [2, 3]
      /     \           /     \
   [0, 0]  [1, 1]     [2, 2]  [3, 3]

Given start=1, end=6. The segment tree will be:

               [1,  6]
             /        \
      [1,  3]           [4,  6]
      /     \           /     \
   [1, 2]  [3,3]     [4, 5]   [6,6]
   /    \           /     \
[1,1]   [2,2]     [4,4]   [5,5]

Clarification
Segment Tree (a.k.a Interval Tree) is an advanced data structure which can support queries like:

which of these intervals contain a given point
which of these points are in a given interval
